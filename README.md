## Contributing

### Create a fork

To contribute to a open source project, you can do a fork from the source code, do your own changes on a copy without compromising the original.

If you don't know how to do that, follow this [guide](https://help.github.com/pt/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

### Git Flow

_GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It has attracted a lot of attention because it is very well suited to collaboration and scaling the development team._

So, in my projects I always try to use that. It's very useful and helps to control what is happing to the code base.

Read a little bit more [about this](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

### Open a Pull Request

With all your changes done, and you are ready to contribute, open a pull request to the _upstream_ `develop` branch. Your PR will be analysed, discuted and aproved gratefuly.
